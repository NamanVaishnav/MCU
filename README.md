Marvel Character Universe 


Everyone loves Marvel & the characters and the stories & what not. Wouldnâ€™t it be awesome to have a directory of all marvel characters where users can just type in the name of the character and get some brief details (name, image, description) about the matched set?

Fortunately enough, Marvel exposes this detail via their APIs & allows people to build custom views. Details: https://developer.marvel.com/

### FEATURES: 

- App will have a screen with bottom navigation and 2 tabs.
- Tab 1 -> Show a grid of characters returned by the apis, should be paginated. Add a search bar on top -> search a query and show characters based on the search query. History of search queries should be shown below the search bar.
- Tab 2 -> Show a grid of all comics returned by the apis. An additional filter option with filters for Released this week, Released last week, Releasing next week and Release this month should be added. Update the grid based on filter selected & also paginate the results.
